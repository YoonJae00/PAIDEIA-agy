"""OCR engine dispatch for paideia-mcp.

Exposes ``run_ocr(engine, png_paths, *, project_root=None) -> list[str]`` which
routes to the requested engine module and returns markdown per page.

The ``codex-native`` engine is a special case: the MCP tool only rasterizes
PDFs to PNG and hands the manifest back to the calling skill, which then asks
Codex CLI to read the page images directly using its bundled vision (the same
vision ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Business subscribers already pay for). Calling
``run_ocr('codex-native', ...)`` therefore raises — there is no in-process OCR
step for that engine.
